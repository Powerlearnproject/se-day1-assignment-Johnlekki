Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Ans- Software engineering is the process of using engeineering methods, tools to develop and maintain quality softwares

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming language- first sets of languages came in existence in the 1940's and 50's i.e fotran, C
Introduction of structured software engineering programmes- THis came after soft enginnering was earlier introduced as a displine and the course where structure
Introduction Agile methodologies- Introduction of agile which focused on flexibility customer feedback List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. ans-1. requirement 2.design 3. Implementation 4. Testing 5. Deployment 6. Maintenance
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. waterfall is sequencial,well documented process, not flexible and predictable while agile is flexible,less documentation, more collaboration and customer feedback Agile is more suitable in government project while agile is more suitable in mobile app development

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software engineer- writing codes and implementing softwares Quality assurance- ensures software quality by designing and testing project manager-planning, management,execution and delivery of software Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. example visual studio and eclipse Integrated development environment is a programme that provides an environment to write ,test and debug codes into a single interface.example visual studio and eclipse Version control system are tools that manages changes to source code and allows collaboration. example Git , subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. Changing environment Managing Technical debt meeting deadlines evolving technologies debugging and troubleshooting complex issues

How to overcome the chanllenges

Changing environment- engage in regular communicationand use agile methodologies Managing Technical debt-regular refactory session to clean up the codebase. meeting deadlines-use time management tools,be realistic and breakdown task into simple units evolving technologies-continuous learning, engage in communities debugging and troubleshooting complex issues- use debugging tools and colaborate with peers.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. unit-testing individual components in isolation integration-testing the interaction between multiple components to ensure they work together as expected system - testing the complete and fully integated software as a whole. acceptance- the final stage of testing to determine if the software is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. Prompt engineering is about crafting questions and statements to get the best possible response from Ai models. It helps in getting concise,clear and precise responses from the Ai models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. Vague prompt List of English speaking schools in Nigeria and British schools Improve prompt List of secondary schools in Nigeria that offer education in English and follow the British curriculum (IGCSE/A-Level). With their location and names.
